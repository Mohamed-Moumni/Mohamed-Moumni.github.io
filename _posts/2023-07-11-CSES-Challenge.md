In order to level up my skills in problem-solving and competitive programming, and of course to avoid procrastination :) that I face every time, I want to do something new that requires commitment and dedication.

So I decided to enroll myself in a challenge that is solving the 300 problems on [CSES](http://cses.fi/) website for every problem I should explain how I solve it and also the algorithm behind it and also the source code of the solution.

For Now, I can limit myself to creating one solution every week, because I am busy with a final school project that I should finish soon.
